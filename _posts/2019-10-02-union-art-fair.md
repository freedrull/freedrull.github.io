We did two art exhibitions this September as cool trash.

The first one was at the union art book fair.

Next was at this very dusty building, we got to put stuff all over the walls and
paint on some cardboard.

We played a live show as Wificellphonekidz at the opening night.
The art was taken down at the end of the opening night.

Both included my forever work in progress game "Burger Zone".
